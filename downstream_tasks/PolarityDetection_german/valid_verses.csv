to water cloudlike on the bush afar 
shall yet be glad for him and he shall bless
on its windy site uplifting gabled roof and palisade 
 if haply the dark will of fate
jehovah jove or lord 
when the brow is cold as the marble stone 
taking and giving radiance and the slopes
press hard the hostile towers 
his head is bowed he thinks on men and kings 
with england if the day go hard 
turn in the door once and turn once only
and ever the rocks disdain 
that to the next i may resign my roome
and all the honors that he sought to leave
a level space of nameless graves 
from his lady s white hand caught 
in three distinguish d parts with three distinguish d guides
a orn ment o saciety in my approprut spear 
ef twarn t for studyin evenins why i never d ha ben here
for ever if that maiden sits enshrined
to feel with bird and stream and tree 
with ten picked archers of my train 
let fall on her a rose leaf rain of dreams 
then ens is represented as father of the predicaments his ten
and politician at odd seasons 
the dusky daughter of the sun 
stood and watched it at the doorway 
while brain wore a plumeless casque not he
what though the claret circled well 
the garrison house stood watching on the gray rocks of cape ann 
alas their right to joy is plain 
did all of them bow downward towards that side
the bronze against the marble breast 
that in their holes abed at close of day
with his thoughts then as rhyme to rhyme 
at last outbound from tunis 
and sleigh bells a jingle
why write i still all one ever the same 
their very peaks transparent ere it fade 
soon ez she gits out o sight 
of common natural things a part 
alone went the fair armed gudrun to her flowery garden close 
lift up the favour of thy count nance bright 
breathe deep and start to see him pass the door 
of things that only children see
and i greet from far the ray 
all passionate sweet as are the loving beams
they still keep piping in their honey dreams 
now betimes on a morning of summer that giuki s daughter arose 
no truly i will see her tell my tale 
which mongst the wanton gods a foul reproach was held 
ere i own an usurper i ll couch with the fox 
nor can express the love it knew 
where its first shadow casts the holy mountain 
might looking up see dian dip
no controversial hebraist was the dame 
will seek the half unjeweled tide 
or dying wail 
turn d back the shafts and mock d the gates of death 
an angel had not startled him 
the quakers burial ground 
and sate as thus upon that slope of lawn
whose voices hushed have left our pathway lonely 
on us lift up the light
each lodger here adorns the walls 
fix d on the walls with wonder and surprise 
i kin eat in peace 
in yonder green meadow to memory dear 
tell me the charms that lovers seek
the second signal sounds the troop divides
this hot sick air and how i covet here
abominations and with cursed things
how the white mountain tops distinctly shine 
willis sneered 
from the bed of minnehaha 
then loosen launch forth to go and compete 
with its chang d countenance is sent away
i envy the farmer s boy
and ever a thrill in mine inmost heart
still in hot and heavy splashes fell the tears on every leaf 
strong tarchon snatch d and bore away his prize 
under the self same bough and heard as there
was borne within the walls which in assyrian rite 
and at my door they cower and die 
weak timid homesick slow to understand
in order though to nations yet unborn 
she of the rugged sides 
but no tidings thread the gloom 
and in some deep and narrow bay then sleeps
 who s we some stockholders in boston 
and tell you in what greek and latin name
nor looks on that dread place
where wisdom and not numbers should have weight 
from the hushed and silent tomb 
his bark her anchor weighed 
two mighty cities shone and ever
unconscious of the passing troop 
with the freedom of lakes and lands 
would he move so as yet they made nothing of land 
shall part yet link thy nature s tone and mine 
said my companion i will show you soon
but god said
but if thou do thy best
so generous to me farewell friend since friend
let me all risk and leave the deep heart dumb
