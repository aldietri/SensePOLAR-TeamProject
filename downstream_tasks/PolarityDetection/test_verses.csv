my canoe to make more steady 
and be glad in the summer morning when the kindred ride on their way 
and when they reached the strait symplegades
she sought for flowers
if they are hungry paradise
indignantly i hurled the cry 
with which his house is haunted 
and laying snow white flowers against my hair 
of long uncoupled bed and childless eld 
of the boulder strewn mountain and when they will crop 
on thine own bird the sweet enthusiasm
said then the lost arch angel this the seat
a simple strain 
his golden cross worn innermostly carved
such days as thou not even thou didst know 
that we must change for heav n this mournful gloom
lo now o daughter of kings let us rise in the face of the day 
for penance by a saintly styrian monk
upon a mountain crag young angelo 
down in lovah s lane 
as o er the earth it wanders wide 
how hearts were answering to his own 
glad on its stone built hearth and thorough the wide mouthed smoke flue
sees the clouds reel and roll above our head 
 tis to behold his vengeance for my son 
i cannot tell rude listeners
points beyond the midnight hour 
i watch the fog float in at the window
those wastes of frozen billows that were hurled
we re perishing and blind 
may george beloved by all the nations round 
bertram finished the last pages while along the silence ever
half the tell tale south wind said 
he hid his gold 
youth i do adore thee 
he stares and shakes and finds it vain to fly 
i look up from this page of thine 
of robert burns and alexander 
crouching and sleeping neath its grassy lair 
for her though god has made her gentle and endearing 
sings the blackened log a tune
push every outpost nearer 
that day 
the life of love that gave it settles 
until my latest breath 
the moon hath veiled her face 
midway the floor with thatch was it strewn burned ever the fire flame
 i rather should have hewn your limbs away 
a wail of utter agony
with shame his glowing cheeks his eyes with fury burn d 
live with heav ns choicest constant blessings crown d 
whut i keer ef day is long 
ah douglass we have fall n on evil days 
through swiftly changing season 
 is this a nightmare or am i
and others say as we have said 
o that i were where helen lies
o mind ye luve how aft we left
he might have been as doubtful once
that i an accessary needs must be 
a fleecy cloud 
shall dwell in the house of my fathers and the land of the people s praise 
dauntless he rose and to the fight return d 
and if my bubbles be too small for you 
to wakeful frenzy s vigil rages 
and through it and round it and over it all
o graves of men who lived and died
for the whole cardinals college or
and the tree trembled and the shouting cries
blow bigger then your own the games we play
the habitable earth is full of bliss 
and yon outlying range invites
but still within my bosom s core
of your strong and pliant branches 
sith i might some counsel find
let sighing breezes call 
 thy kingdom come with his reveal√©d face
i see the thing as clear as light 
fit for an abbot of theleme 
and i turned away to thee 
the fear of angels awful though they be 
down deep in the ground a box of gold 
like those famed seven who slept three ages 
their names let hands of horn and tan
with the whole world gone blind 
and wildly tossed from cheeks and chin 
of my wit or in my mind
the night had found to him a night of wo 
but fixing on the horrid maid his eye 
roamed amongst the roses white and red 
yea soon no consonant unsmooth
from its stem the ripening ear 
this endless outrage shall they still sustain 
shall troy renew d be forc d and fir d again 
which overflows in notes of liquid gladness 
where the warm life we cannot see 
i met them one day and each had a flower
thus while the trojan prince employs his eyes 
they beached their galley on the shore and sought
shall live my highland mary 
now is past since last we met
begins to live
beneath the hazel bough 
daring to ask for naught and having naught received
